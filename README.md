# STA-Windfall

Provides another avenue to get seeds, insect eggs, SciencePoints and Currency.

## How to install

- Read the guide at my [ellacharmed.wordpress.com](https://ellacharmed.wordpress.com/2019/11/04/how-to-use-mods-in-surviving-the-aftermath/) blog page.

## Design considerations

- Event would remain visible for 240sec and random chance of it occuring again after cooldown of 180sec.
- The attempt to set global resource like water, energy <del>and SciencePoints</del> is still unsuccessful.
- The initial DaysPassed trigger removed, as update 9 introduces Game Phases.

## Requirements

- Triggering event is the Gate is built. The number of game days and game phases is not taken into account.

## Expected outcome

- A positive outcome is the chance of getting some combination of seeds and/or insect eggs, between 100-1000 SciencePoints for Research, and between 100-1000 Currency for Trade.
- A negative outcome is one (or more) colonist(s) get injured.
