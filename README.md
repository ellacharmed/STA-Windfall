Description

    Triggering event is the gate is built.
    It would occur from day 2 onwards (if gate is built) up to day 250; between midday and midnight.
    Event would remain visible for 240sec and random chance of it occuring again after cooldown of 180sec.
    A positive outcome is the chance of getting some combination of seeds and/or insect eggs.
    A negative outcome is one (or more) colonist(s) get injured.
    The attempt to set global resource like water, energy and SciencePoints is still unsuccessful
